    <h3>Hey there, what’s up?</h3>

    <p>
      Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you’ll have
      more fun. Whoa, this guy’s straight? It’s a hug, Michael. I’m hugging you.
      Well, what do you expect, mother? I’m afraid I just blue myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy’s a pro. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I don’t criticize
      you! And if you’re worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best
      defense. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s called ‘taking advantage.’ It’s what gets you ahead in life. I’ve
      opened a door here that I regret. Marry me. Guy’s a pro.
